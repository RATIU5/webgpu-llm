# WebGPU and TypeGPU Documentation

> Comprehensive learning resources for building GPU-accelerated applications using WebGPU and TypeGPU in TypeScript projects. This documentation covers everything from understanding the WebGPU API fundamentals to leveraging TypeGPU's type-safe abstractions for writing shaders in TypeScript, enabling developers to create high-performance graphics and compute applications in the browser.

This documentation is designed for intermediate TypeScript developers who want to harness GPU computing power in web applications. You should have familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript, basic understanding of 3D graphics concepts, and some experience with asynchronous programming patterns.

WebGPU is the successor to WebGL, providing modern GPU access with compute shader support, better performance characteristics, and alignment with native graphics APIs like Vulkan, Metal, and Direct3D 12. TypeGPU is a type-safe toolkit that abstracts WebGPU complexity, allowing you to write shaders in TypeScript with full type checking and automatic WGSL generation.
